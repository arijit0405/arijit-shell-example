Definition: Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that tracks changes to files, especially source code, over time. It enables developers to manage versions, collaborate, and revert to previous states of a project if needed.

Purpose: Version control and code management on your local machine.

Key Features:

Version Control: Git allows developers to track changes in code, commit versions, and create branches for parallel work.

Local Operations: You can use Git without internet access; all operations (e.g., commit, diff, log) are local. Changes can be pushed to a remote server later when needed.

Branching and Merging: Git allows developers to create separate branches for different features and merge them when they are ready, helping manage large projects.

Collaboration: Git is designed for multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.


GitHub

Definition: GitHub is a cloud-based platform (or service) that provides a graphical interface and additional collaboration features on top of Git. It hosts Git repositories and offers tools for managing projects and teams.

Key Features:


Remote Hosting: GitHub hosts Git repositories in the cloud, allowing developers to collaborate from anywhere by cloning, pushing, or pulling changes.

Collaboration Tools: GitHub offers a web-based interface for managing pull requests, issues, and project boards, helping teams track tasks and features.

Pull Requests: This feature allows developers to propose changes to a repository, discuss them, review code, and then merge it.

Forking: Developers can copy a repository (called a "fork") and make their own changes without affecting the original codebase, which can later be merged via pull requests.

Social Features: GitHub has a community aspect, where you can follow developers, star repositories, and watch projects for updates.

GitHub Actions (CI/CD): GitHub provides tools for automating tasks, such as testing and deploying code, using GitHub Actions, which are part of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

Private Repositories: GitHub allows private and public repositories, making it suitable for open-source and private project hosting.
